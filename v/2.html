        <h3>Out of control</h3>

        <p>
          Richard's mother dismissed all signs of Richards adolescent rebellion, and really thought nothing of it.<br>
          And the worse was her inconsistency using her discipline methods. When Richard was grounded or put on restriction, 
          he simply got out of it by nagging her, or just ignore it.<br>
          And so as this continued, Richard's grades dropped, and his attitude got worse and worse.

        <h3>Decision</h3>

        <p>
          Richard had gotten so used to the freedom, and mothers permissive discipline, that he was getting more out of hand than before.<br>
          Richard's mother began to realize that maybe grounding and "a good talking to" weren't helping.<br>
          Things had to be changed. So finally Richard's mother decided to request for support in Birchham - a grim boarding school.

        <h3>Request to take Richard under strict discipline</h3>

        <p>
          Miss Vera - the superior governess - was very pleased as Richard's mother asked her for help.<br>
          She informed Richard's mother that the boy had to expect severe punishments, including harsh taswings, birchings and canings on his bare buttocks. 
          Regular thrashings until his backside was black and blue.

        <p>
          Miss Vera prepared all punishment instruments she intended to use on the poor boys backside.
